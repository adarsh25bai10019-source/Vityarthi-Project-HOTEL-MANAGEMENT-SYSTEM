# STATEMENT OF PURPOSE  
**Sunrise Hotel Management System**  

### Problem Statement

In small hotels, lodges, and guest houses, room booking and guest management are still done manually using paper registers. This leads to many problems:

- Difficulty in checking real-time room availability  
- High chance of double-booking the same room  
- Time wasted in searching guest details during check-out  
- Errors in calculating bills  
- No quick way to see who is currently staying  

There was a need for a simple, fast, and error-free system that even a person with basic computer knowledge can use at the reception counter without any internet or complicated software.

### Scope of the Project

This project is a lightweight, standalone Hotel Room Management System developed using only core Python (no external libraries or database). It simulates the complete front-desk workflow of a small 10-room hotel named “Sunrise Hotel”. All data is kept in memory using lists and dictionaries, making it easy to understand and modify.

The current version covers the essential day-to-day operations of a small hotel and serves as a perfect learning project for understanding data structures and console application development in Python.

### Target Users

- Reception staff of small hotels, guest houses, homestays, and lodges  
- College/school students learning Python (as a mini/project assignment)  
- Beginners who want to see a real-world use of lists and dictionaries  
- Teachers looking for simple, complete projects to teach programming concepts
