#  Sunrise Hotel Management System 

**A Simple Console-Based Hotel Booking System made in Python**  
*(First-Year Mini Project – 2025)*

Hey there!  This is a small but complete Hotel Management System I built as my first-year Python project. It can book rooms, check-in guests, generate bills at checkout, and show who’s currently staying – everything a small hotel’s reception needs!

It’s 100% made in Python, no internet or database needed – everything runs in your terminal!

###  Features

- Beautiful welcome screen (feels like a real hotel!)
- See all rooms → type, price, and live status (Available / Occupied)
- Book a room by entering name, phone, and number of nights
- Check-in → gets a warm welcome message
- Check-out → shows a neat final bill and frees the room
- View all current guests anytime
- Prevents double booking (you can’t book an occupied room)
- Fun & friendly messages in English + little Hindi touch ("Arre", "yaar", "full house today!")
